Put in here all MVC implementations ... ;)

Some brief explanations, why I used 'this' not 'that'.
When you develop you should stick with the best practices, even if at the beginning it will require more work to be done.

In the code examples I was trying to stick with:
SOLID - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)
DRY - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself
VO - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_object
DTO - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object
Application Layers - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture

All the code has to be well documented in English.

TODOs:
- implement the MVC design pattern,
- implement the whole application logic (I've just created an abstract overview how it can look),
- write Unit Tests for most important parts of the application.
